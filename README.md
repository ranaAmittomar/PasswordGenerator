# PasswordGenerator
‚ú® Advanced Password Generation: We've created a state-of-the-art password generator that crafts strong and unique passwords at the touch of a button.

üîê Secure Storage: Our app provides a secure vault for storing sensitive login credentials, ensuring your digital life remains protected.

üåê Seamless Integration: We've integrated RESTful APIs and leveraged third-party libraries to enhance functionality and connectivity.

üîç Dependency Injection: I applied modern Dependency Injection techniques to ensure modular, maintainable, and scalable code.

üé® User-Friendly Design: With a focus on user experience, we designed an intuitive interface that caters to users of all tech levels.

üåü Results: Our project delivers a comprehensive password management solution that combines security, ease of use, and performance optimization.

FUTURE SCOPE :- 

Password Strength Checker: You can integrate a RESTful API that analyzes password strength. When a user generates a password, the app sends the password to the API, which returns a strength score. Based on this score, your app can provide feedback to the user, such as whether the password is strong enough or if it needs further complexity.

Password Recovery: In case a user forgets their master password or login credentials, implementing a password recovery feature. When the user initiates a recovery request, the app can communicate with a RESTful API that sends a recovery link or code to the user's registered email. This link or code can then be used to reset their password.

Cloud Backup: Allow users to securely back up their stored passwords to a cloud service. Can integrate with a cloud storage API, like Google Drive or Dropbox, to automatically store and retrieve encrypted password data.

Password Sync:  Users can sync their saved passwords across their Android devices using a RESTful API to store and retrieve password data from a centralized server.

Security Alerts: Utilize a RESTful API to provide real-time security alerts. The app can periodically check for data breaches or security vulnerabilities associated with the user's saved passwords and provide notifications or recommendations to update passwords.

Password Recovery: Implement a feature that allows users to recover their account or access their passwords from a new device. Users can initiate a recovery process, and the app can use a RESTful API to verify their identity and provide access to their stored passwords.
